# [WIP] cipherl

_note: work in progress, do not use for now_

*cipherl* is an Erlang application allowing exchange of crypted and signed messages between nodes.

## Why cipherl ?

- Basic Erlang distribution is not secure.  See [this](https://www.erlang.org/doc/reference_manual/distributed.html#security).
- Enabling TLS distribution is not easy. See [this](https://www.erlang.org/doc/apps/ssl/ssl_distribution.html).
